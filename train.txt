twice O

a O
small O
son O

in O
their O
opinion O
there O
was O
no O

anywhere O
. O

the B-PER

everything O

fear O
was O
that O

would O
discover O
it O

didn O
' O
t O
think O

it O
if O
anyone O
found O
out O
about O
the B-PER
potters I-PER
. O

the B-PER

they O
had O
never O
even O
seen O
him O

this O
boy O
was O
another O

reason O
for O
keeping O
the B-PER
potters I-PER
away O
; O
they O
didn O
' O
t O
want O

gingerly O
on O

the O
twinkling O
light O
that O

shone O
from O
dumbledore B-PER
' O

nearly O
ten O

to O
find O
their O
nephew O
on O

, O
but O
privet O
drive O
had O
hardly O
changed O
at O
all O
. O

dursley B-PER
had O
seen O
that O
fateful O
news O
report O
about O
the O
owls O
. O

ten O
years O
ago O
, O
there O
had O
been O
lots O
of O
pictures O
of O
what O
looked O
like O
a O
large O
pink O
beach O
ball O
wearing O
different O
- O
colored O
bonnets O

- O
but O
dursley O
was O
no O
longer O
a O
baby O
, O
and O
now O
the O
photographs O
showed O
a O
large O
blond O
boy O
riding O
his O
first O
bicycle O
, O
on O
a O
carousel O
at O
the O
fair O
, O
playing O
a O
computer O

with O
his O

kissed O
by O
his O
mother O

yet O
harry B-PER
potter I-PER
was O
still O
there O
, O
asleep O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
but O
not O
for O
long O
. O

his O
aunt O
petunia B-PER
was O
awake O
and O
it O
was O
her O
shrill O
voice O
that O
made O
the O
first O
noise O
of O
the O
day O
. O

harry B-PER
woke O
with O
a O
start O
. O

harry B-PER
heard O
her O
walking O
toward O
the O
kitchen O

then O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
frying O

on O
the O

" O

harry B-PER
groaned O
. O

dudley B-PER
' O
s O
birthday O
- O
- O
how O
could O
he O
have O
forgotten O
? O
harry B-PER
got O
slowly O
out O
of O
bed O
and O
started O
looking O
for O
socks O
. O

harry B-PER
was O
used O
to O
spiders O
, O
because O
the O
cupboard O
under O
the O
stairs O
was O
full O
of O
them O
, O
and O
that O
was O
where O
he O
slept O
. O

the O
table O
was O
almost O
hidden O
beneath O
all O
dudley B-PER
' O
s O
birthday O
presents O
. O

it O
looked O
as O
though O
dudley B-PER
had O
gotten O
the O
new O
computer O
he O
wanted O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
the O
second O
television O
and O
the O
racing O
bike O
. O

exactly O
why O
dudley B-PER
wanted O
a O
racing O
bike O
was O
a O
mystery O
to O
harry O
, O
as O
dudley B-PER
was O
very O
fat O
and O
hated O
exercise O
- O
- O
unless O
of O
course O
it O
involved O
punching O
somebody O
. O

dudley B-PER
' O
s O
favorite O
punching O
bag O
was O
harry B-PER
, O
but O
he O
couldn O
' O
t O
often O
catch O
him O
. O

harry B-PER
didn O
' O
t O
look O
it O
, O
but O
he O
was O
very O
fast O
. O

perhaps O
it O
had O
something O
to O
do O
with O
living O
in O
a O
dark O
cupboard O
, O
but O
harry B-PER
had O
always O
been O
small O
and O
skinny O
for O
his O
age O
. O

he O
looked O
even O
smaller O
and O
skinnier O
than O
he O
really O
was O
because O
all O
he O
had O
to O
wear O
were O
old O
clothes O
of O
dudley B-PER
' O
s O
, O
and O
dudley B-PER
was O
about O
four O
times O
bigger O
than O
he O
was O
. O

harry B-PER
had O
a O
thin O
face O
, O
knobbly O
knees O
, O
black O
hair O
, O
and O
bright O
green O
eyes O
. O

he O
wore O
round O
glasses O
held O
together O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
scotch O
tape O
because O
of O
all O
the O
times O
dudley B-PER
had O
punched O
him O
on O
the O
nose O
. O

the O
only O
thing O
harry B-PER
liked O
about O
his O
own O
appearance O
was O
a O
very O
thin O
scar O
on O
his O
forehead O
that O
was O
shaped O
like O
a O
bolt O
of O
lightning O
. O

quiet O
life O
with O

entered O
the O
kitchen O
as O
harry B-PER
was O
turning O
over O
the O
bacon O
. O

about O
once O
a O
week O
, O
uncle B-PER
vernon I-PER
looked O
over O
the O
top O
of O
his O
newspaper O
and O
shouted O
that O
harry O
needed O
a O
haircut O
. O

harry B-PER
must O
have O
had O
more O
haircuts O
than O

rest O
of O
the O
boys O
in O
his O
class O
put O
together O
, O

it O
made O
no O
difference O
, O
his O
hair O
simply O
grew O
that O
way O
- O
- O
all O
over O
the O
place O
. O

harry B-PER
was O
frying O
eggs O
by O
the O
time O
dudley B-PER
arrived O
in O
the O
kitchen O
with O
his O
mother O
. O

dudley B-PER
looked O
a O
lot O
like O
uncle B-PER
vernon I-PER
. O

aunt B-PER
petunia I-PER
often O
said O

up O

then O
, O
because O
the B-PER
smiling O

, O
licking O
it O
as O
they O
watched O
a O
gorilla O
scratching O
its O

who O
looked O
remarkably O
like O

in O

long O
time O

he O
was O
careful O
to O
walk O
a O
little O
way O
apart O
from O
the B-PER
dursleys I-PER
so O
that O
dudley B-PER
and O

, O
who O
were O
starting O
to O
get O
bored O
with O

, O
wouldn O
' O

of O
hitting O
him O
. O

they O
ate O
in O
the O

, O
and O
when O
dudley B-PER
had O
a O
tantrum O
because O

knickerbocker O
glory O
didn O
' O
t O
have O

, O
uncle B-PER

bought O
him O
another O
one O
and O
harry B-PER
was O
allowed O
to O
finish O
the O
first O
. O

harry B-PER
felt O
, O
afterward O
, O
that O
he O
should O
have O
known O
it O
was O
all O
too O
good O
to O

. O

dudley B-PER

cobras O
and O
thick O
, O
man O
- O
crushing O

. O

dudley B-PER
quickly O
found O
the O
largest O
snake O
in O
the O
place O
. O

dudley B-PER
stood O
with O
his O
nose O
pressed O
against O
the O
glass O
, O
staring O
at O
the O
glistening O
brown O
coils O
. O

uncle B-PER
vernon I-PER
tapped O
on O
the O
glass O
, O
but O
the O
snake O
didn O
' O
t O
budge O
. O

" O
do O
it O
again O
, O
" O
dudley B-PER
ordered O
. O

uncle B-PER
vernon I-PER
rapped O
the O
glass O
smartly O
with O
his O
knuckles O
, O
but O
the O
snake O
just O
snoozed O
on O
. O

" O
this O
is O
boring O
, O
" O
dudley B-PER
moaned O
. O

harry B-PER
moved O
in O
front O
of O
the O
tank O
and O
looked O
intently O
at O
the O
snake O
. O

it O
was O
worse O
than O
having O
a O
cupboard O
as O
a O
bedroom O
, O
where O
the O
only O
visitor O
was O
aunt B-PER

hammering O
on O
the O

to O

up O
; O
at O

he O
got O
to O
visit O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
house O
. O

slowly O
, O
very O
slowly O
, O
it O
raised O
its O
head O
until O
its O
eyes O
were O
on O
a O
level O
with O
harry B-PER
' O

. O

harry B-PER
stared O
. O

the O
snake O
jerked O
its O
head O
toward O
uncle B-PER
vernon I-PER
and O
dudley B-PER
, O
then O
raised O
its O
eyes O
to O
the O
ceiling O
. O

it O
gave O
harry B-PER
a O
look O
that O
said O
quite O
plainly O
: O
" O

time O

" O

" O
harry B-PER
murmured O
through O
the O
glass O
, O
though O
he O
wasn O
' O
t O
sure O
the O
snake O
could O
hear O
him O
. O
" O

the O
boa O
constrictor O
jabbed O
its O
tail O
at O
the O
sign O
again O

harry B-PER
read O
on O
: O

as O
the O

shook O
its O
head O
, O
a O
deafening O

behind O

up O

past O

there O

a O
horrible O
smell O

the O
next O

harry B-PER
seriously O
doubted O

. O

dudley B-PER
and O
uncle B-PER
vernon I-PER
came O
in O
, O
both O
with O
wrinkled O

because O
of O
the O
smell O
from O

uncle B-PER

dudley B-PER
banged O
his O
smelting O

he O
carried O
everywhere O
, O
on O
the O
table O
. O

" O

went O
to O
get O

three O
things O

a O
brown O

looked O
like O

- O
- O
a O
letter O
for O
harry B-PER
. O

harry B-PER
picked O
it O
up O
and O
stared O
at O
it O
, O
his O
heart O
twanging O
like O
a O
giant O
elastic O
band O
. O

yet O
here O
it O
was O
, O
a O

turning O
the O

over O
, O
his O
hand O
trembling O
, O

a O
lion O

. O

harry B-PER
went O
back O
to O
the O

uncle B-PER

ripped O
open O

which O
was O
written O
on O
the O

heavy O

over O
